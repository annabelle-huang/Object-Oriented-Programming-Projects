I liked how we were able to help each other with areas of knowledge we didn’t understand. The process of writing code was much easier as well since I have a partner to discuss my ideas with. I learned a lot from my partner and he gave out many good ideas to implement in our code, saving us from redundancy.


The assignment helped me understand design patterns more concretely by making me utilize the patterns in parts of the code. I had to think about how to use the iterator pattern in the code. After thinking about using it for traversing the entire board like a double for loop and various other traversal methods, I decided the most useful thing was to iterate around each board space in a circle. 


I thought the memento design pattern was the most interesting, since I never thought of storing an object's previous states in a list before to keep track of movements. This made ‘undo’ and ‘redo’ much easier to work with. 


Overall, this was a successful learning experience and I enjoyed working with my partner.
